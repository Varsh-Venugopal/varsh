    <h1>A dead body is found at the bottom of a multistory building. Seeing the position of the bodyit is evident that the person jumped off from one of the floor for attempting suicide.A homicide detective is called to look after the case. He goes to the first floor and walks inthe room facing the direction in which the body was found. He opens the window in thatdirection and flips a coin towards the floor.The he goes to the second floor and repeats the process. He keeps on doing it till the lastfloor. Then, when he climbs down, he tells the team that it is a murder not suicide.How did he come to know that it was a murder?(hint it happened in 1949)</h1>

<a href="index-href.html">At each floor, he did the same task of opening the window and flipping the coin. If it was a suicide, then at least the window at any of the floor must have been left open by the personwho jumped off. The present situation only suggests that someone pushed him off and thenclosed the window again. </a>
